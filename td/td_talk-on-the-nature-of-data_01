* 2000:Data Mining knowledge Discovery from Databases;
* 2010:Big Data
* 2020:Data Science
  * The idea remains the same.
    * Put the fastest,largest hadrware together with the fastest algorithms and the most efficient programing systems to solve problems in the commercial and scientific worlds
  * There are many to whom "data science" means machine learning.
  * Statisticians tend to believe that statistics is the essential ingredient in data science.
  * My view:data science is a natural evolution of database systems research.
    * More importantly:the best preparation for success in data science is the core of CS education with specialization suitable to handing large-scale data.
* Machine learning has created some very powerful approaches to algorithm development.
  * Often clear winners over conventional algorithms.
* Statisticians are really smart people who have over the years,developed many vital concepts and techniques.
  * Many are now doing the same sort of work that we see in computer science.

  * My option:
    * Substantive Expertise => Normally "domain knowledge"
    * Computer Science => It's called CS.And it's a lot more than writing code.
    * Danger Zone! => Danger?Really?Most data science operates here.
    * Traditional Rearch => True?Applying math without algorithms is a tradition?
    * Machine Learning => Really?ML is just math/sta Implemented,with out application?

* The Statistics Claim to Fame
  * Concede:Stat is useful when designing randomized algorithms and when analyzing the expected behavior of algorithms on random data.
  * Concede:There are applications where statistical validity is the critical issue.
  * Example:When census data is reported,there are political consequences to statements like "10% of the population is below the poverty line."
    * You need to get that right.
* A Problem with the Stats Approach
  * Statisticians put too much value on "analyzing" data,rather than using the data to solve problems.
  * Example:Statistics version of "hackathon" that provides data and simply asks contestants to "find something interesting" in the data.
  * Why not ask for an algorithm to do something with the data that people will find useful?
    * Like Kaggle Competitions,e.g.
* Another Stats Problem
  * Data science is largely experimental.
    * We'll learn the behavior of our algorithms in the real world and modify them if the performance is bad.
  * The mistake to avoid:In most applications of data science,doing the best you can is more important than knowing exactly how well you are doing.
* Example:Phishing Attacks
  * Google is pretty good at detecting email that is a phishing attack.
  * How good?
  * Who can tell?
    * Since attacks evolve,even if we had a precise statistical analysis of the rate of failure today,it would mean little tommorrow.
  * And if you regard this application of "hacking" as in the "danger zone",i claim the real danger is people seding their life savings to someone who claims to be a Nigerian prince.
* Many Other Examples
  * Relating individual genomes to proper medical treatment.
  * Predicting paths of hurriances,typhoons,etc.
  * Even predicting best ads to show or movies to recommend.
* The Machine-Learning Claim
  * Concede:Many important problems in data science are asking for a model of some phenomenon in some application area.
  * Concede:Machine learning often provides more accurate models than other aooproaches.

* Objections to "ML=Data Science"
  * Objection #1:The ML community claims as its own ideas that really came from elsewhere/
    * E.g.,clustering,gradient descent,association rules.
  * Objection #2:Not every data-science problem is the search for a model.
  * Objection #3:Understandability(sometimes)counts.
* Association Rules
  * Association rules are if-then rules about a set of "items" that cause effects.
  * Discovered by counting co-occurrences of sets of items in "baskets."
  * Developed by the database community in the 1990's.
* Example:Phishing Attacks
  * Items are words in phishing emails(the "baskets").
  * Discovered rules tell that certain combinations of words indicate phishing attacks.
    * E.g.:"Nigerian" and "Prince" -> phishing
